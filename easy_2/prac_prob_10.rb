=begin

Back in the stone age (before CSS) we used spaces to align things on the screen
If we had a table of Flintstone family members that was fourty characters in 
width, how could we easily center that title above the table with spaces?
=end

title = "Flintstone Family Members"
title.center(40)

# go back and see if you can use center in the bannerizer problem
